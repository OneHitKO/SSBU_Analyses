A side project dedicated to analyzing character move sets from Nintendo's SSBU. What makes certain characters S-tier on the competitive level? 

* [View Start Up Frames vs KO Percentage data](https://onehitko.shinyapps.io/SSBU_FastestKO/).

### Ongoing projects:
* Incorporation of endlag frame data for each move
* Side-by-side (or overlapping) comparison of different character movesets
* In-depth comparison and visualization of character stats (weight, speed, gravity, etc)
* Link to hitbox data/animations
* Top tier character prediction based on moveset and physical stats
